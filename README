This genetic algorithm is designed to minimise the problem specific code from a genetic algorithm. The three interfaces Gene, Initialiser, an Evaluator need to be implemented for each problem.
By keeping the contents of genes abstract in the majority of the code it allows for most of the algorithm to be generic. Problems arrise for example if you have a individual with differnt types of genes and use a crossover method that does not maintain gene positions. A custom crossover function could be used.

Any suggestions to the logic or implemention of the code are welcome.
